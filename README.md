Tired of explorer maps only leading to the same two structures? Have you ever wished you could get a map to a Bastion, an Ancient City, or even a simple Pillager Outpost? **EM4ES** is the solution!

This lightweight, server-side mod expands the exploration experience by introducing new trades for maps that can lead to **any structure in the game**. It stands for **E**xplorer **M**aps **4** **E**very **S**tructure.

## Features

*   **Dynamic Explorer Maps:** Adds new explorer maps that can point to any structure defined in a simple config file, including those from other mods!
*   **New Villager & Trader Stock:** Integrates these maps seamlessly into vanilla gameplay through two sources:
    *   **Cartographer Villagers:** Cartographers now have a progressive trade system for these special maps.
    *   **Wandering Traders:** The world's traveler now sells a variety of maps to distant and exciting locations.
*   **Balanced Progression:**
    *   A brand new **Novice (Level 1) Cartographer** will offer **3** unique structure maps.
    *   As you level up a Cartographer, it will unlock **1 additional map trade** at each new professional level (Apprentice, Journeyman, Expert, and Master).
    *   The **Wandering Trader** will spawn with a stock of **3** random structure maps.
*   **Customizable Price:** The price for all maps is fixed at **10 Trial Keys**, providing a new and interesting use for this vanilla item.
*   **Controlled Search Radius:** To ensure balanced gameplay, all maps generated by this mod will search for structures within a **1000-block radius**.
*   **Full Configuration:** You have full control over which structures can appear on maps via a simple whitelist file.

## How It Works

1.  **Find a Trader:** Locate a Wandering Trader or a Cartographer Villager.
2.  **Check Their Trades:** They will now offer Explorer Maps with names like "Pillager Outpost Map" or "Ancient City Map" in exchange for 10 Trial Keys.
3.  **Buy a Map:** Purchase the map for a structure you wish to find.
4.  **Explore!** Follow the map just like you would a vanilla treasure map to find your destination.

This system provides a renewable and engaging way for players to find and explore all the content their world has to offer.

## Configuration

**EM4ES** is fully configurable through a whitelist file generated on the first server startup:

**File Location:** `config/EM4ES/StructureWhitelist.cfg`

This file contains a simple list of all structure identifiers that the mod is allowed to create maps for (e.g., `minecraft:village_plains`, `minecraft:bastion_remnant`).

**To customize the available maps:**
*   Simply open the `StructureWhitelist.cfg` file with any text editor.
*   **Remove the lines** corresponding to any structures you don't want maps for. For example, if you don't want players to easily find villages, just delete the lines for `minecraft:village_plains`, `minecraft:village_desert`, etc.
*   Save the file and restart your server. The changes will take effect immediately.

This allows server owners and modpack makers to tailor the exploration experience perfectly for their players.
