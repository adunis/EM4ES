# EM4ES: Explorer Maps for Every Structure

Tired of explorer maps only leading to the same two structures? Have you ever wished you could get a map to a Bastion, an Ancient City, or even structures from your favorite mods? **EM4ES** is the solution!

This lightweight, server-side mod expands the exploration experience by introducing new trades for maps that can lead to **any structure in the game**. It stands for **E**xplorer **M**aps **4** **E**very **S**tructure.

## Features

*   **Dynamic Explorer Maps:** Adds new explorer maps that can point to any structure defined in a powerful config file, including those from other mods!
*   **New Villager & Trader Stock:** Integrates these maps seamlessly into vanilla gameplay through two sources:
    *   **Cartographer Villagers:** Cartographers now have a progressive trade system for these special maps.
    *   **Wandering Traders:** The world's traveler now sells a variety of maps to distant and exciting locations.
*   **Progressive Unlocks:**
    *   A brand new **Novice (Level 1) Cartographer** will offer **3** unique structure maps.
    *   As you level up a Cartographer, it will unlock **3 additional map trades** at each new professional level (Apprentice, Journeyman, Expert, and Master).
    *   The **Wandering Trader** will spawn with a stock of **3** random structure maps.
*   **Fully Configurable Economy:** The cost for every single map is completely customizable! By default, all maps cost **1 Trial Key**, but you can change this to any item and any amount you want.
*   **Controlled Search Radius:** To save server resources, all maps generated by this mod will search for structures within a configurable radius. 

## How It Works

1.  **Find a Trader:** Locate a Wandering Trader or a Cartographer Villager.
2.  **Check Their Trades:** They will now offer Explorer Maps with names like "Pillager Outpost Map" or "Ancient City Map".
3.  **Pay the Price:** Purchase the map for the price defined in the config (by default, 10 Trial Keys).
4.  **Explore!** Follow the map just like you would a vanilla treasure map to find your destination.

This system provides a renewable and engaging way for players to find and explore all the content their world has to offer.

## Advanced Configuration

**EM4ES** features a powerful configuration system that gives you complete control over the mod's economy. On the first server startup, it will generate a properties file:

**File Location:** `config/EM4ES/EM4ES.properties`

This file allows you to set a custom price for every single structure map.

### How to Edit Costs

The format is simple: `structure_id = count item_id`

When the file is first created, it will look like this:

```properties
# This file configures the costs and behavior for explorer maps.

# --- Performance Settings ---
search.sampleSize = 40
search.maxTimeMs = 1500

# --- Wandering Trader Settings ---
trader.mapCount = 20
trader.searchRadius = 2500

# --- Cartographer Settings (searchRadius is in chunks!) ---
cartographer.level1.mapCount = 3
cartographer.level1.searchRadius = 500
cartographer.level1.maxUses = 1
cartographer.level2.mapCount = 3
cartographer.level2.searchRadius = 750
cartographer.level2.maxUses = 1
cartographer.level3.mapCount = 3
cartographer.level3.searchRadius = 1000
cartographer.level3.maxUses = 1
cartographer.level4.mapCount = 3
cartographer.level4.searchRadius = 1500
cartographer.level4.maxUses = 1
cartographer.level5.mapCount = 3
cartographer.level5.searchRadius = 2500
cartographer.level5.maxUses = 1

default.cost = 1 minecraft:trial_key

nova_structures:remnant_bridge_remnant = 10 minecraft:trial_key
nova_structures:tavern_oak = 10 minecraft:trial_key
ati_structures:dojo = 10 minecraft:trial_key
legends_untold:water_den = 10 minecraft:trial_key
awesomedungeonocean:ocean_cage = 10 minecraft:trial_key
repurposed_structures:temple_nether_basalt = 10 minecraft:trial_key
towns_and_towers:village_meadow = 10 minecraft:trial_key
ati_structures:silverfish_nest = 10 minecraft:trial_key
rpg-minibosses:pit = 10 minecraft:trial_key
ati_structures:wither_cavern = 10 minecraft:trial_key
ati_structures:quarry = 10 minecraft:trial_key
repurposed_structures:village_crimson = 10 minecraft:trial_key
nova_structures:remnant_medium_remnant = 10 minecraft:trial_key
rpg-minibosses:desert_camp = 10 minecraft:trial_key
awesomedungeonnether:nth_giant_crimson_tree = 10 minecraft:trial_key
# ... and so on for every structure from every mod
```

You can edit any line to change the cost for that specific structure's map.

#### **Examples:**

*   **Make Mansion maps rare and expensive:**
    Change the line to: `minecraft:mansion = 50 minecraft:trial_key`

*   **Make Village maps cheap and use a different currency:**
    Change the line to: `minecraft:village_plains = 10 minecraft:emerald`

*   **Make Ancient City maps a true endgame prize:**
    Change the line to: `minecraft:ancient_city = 1 minecraft:nether_star`

*   **Change the default price for all un-edited maps:**
    Modify the special `default.cost` key at the top of the file:
    `default.cost = 2 minecraft:diamond`

### Enabling/Disabling Maps

To prevent a map for a certain structure from ever being sold, simply **delete the line** for that structure from the `StructureCosts.properties` file.

This allows server owners and modpack makers to tailor the exploration and economy perfectly for their players.
